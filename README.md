# Computer-Graphics
#### Computer Graphics Project of UTS using OpenGL

This project consists of an interactive 3D house model programmed using OpenGL (WebGL).

The different items which can be found inside the house can be moved and placed anyway in the grid, but always considering collisions between them or fixed objects, such as walls. The texture of these walls can be chosen between a set of different patterns, as well as the floor one.

Lighting can also be changed in intensity among the different spotlights, which also respect shadows and the movement of the object which generates them implies that the spotlight position will move too.

There are two cameras available, which will provide the user a different point of view of the same grid.

Between the options provided in the GUI, there is a manual in which provides a further understanding of the controls.

This project was considered as one of the best ones during the semester. The calification obtained was "High Distinction".
